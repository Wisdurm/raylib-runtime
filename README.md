## Raylib bindings for Runtime

This repository hosts [raylib](github.com/raysan5/raylib) bindings for language [Runtime](https://github.com/Wisdurm/Runtime).  
In case it isn't obvious, these are very unfinished (atm there's basically nothing lol), but on some rainy day, 
I may eventually finish these. That or I'll write some code to automatically generate bindings from header files.  
In the meantime, feel free to contribute :grin: :horse:
